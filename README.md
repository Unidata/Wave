Weather Analysis and Visualization Environment


This is my long term project for an OpenGL weather visualization environment.

Current plans are to get to the point of having an open-source OpenGL-based radar viewer that runs on all 3 platforms.

Hopefully also mobile will be possible, given the Qt stack this is based upon.

Future plans also include having a Python plugin interface.
