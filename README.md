Wave

Weather Analysis and Visualization Environment

**Currently in development, not suitable for use.**

WAVE is a long-term project aimed at testing python's suitability for a next generation geoscience data viewer. It is being developed incrementally combining matplotlib for display, pyqt for GUI, metpy and numpy for data analysis and handling, and siphon for data retrieval. 

Current Features:
- Plotting a GFS 0.5km atmospheric sounding given lat/long for the current time

Anticipated Features:
- Atmospheric variable mapping for entire U.S. (later by bounding box)
- Radar (reflectivity/velocity) images for all stations
- Point data display for entire U.S. (later by bounding box)
