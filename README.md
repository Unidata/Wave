Weather Analysis and Visualization Environment

Current Features:
- Plotting best GFS 0.5km atmospheric sounding given lat/long for current time

Anticipated Features:
- Atmospheric variable mapping for entire U.S. (later by bounding box)
- Radar (reflectivity/velocity) images for all stations
- Point data display for entire U.S. (later by bounding box)

TO DO LIST:

1. ~~Layout of submit/cancel button on skew-t dialog needs to be fixed~~
2. Error dialog box needs formatting
3. Attach Qvalidators to lat/long boxes
4. Use existing matplotlib functions to allow zooming and saving of image
5. Subclass matplotlib nav bar to use in GUI
6. Begin developing funcs for radar and grid data retrieval/visualization
